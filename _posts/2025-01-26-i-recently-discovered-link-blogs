I recently discovered the concept of the link blog. I've wanted a space of my own on the web for a while, and this seemed like the perfect, no pressure way to do it. Here's how Wikipedia defines a link blog:

> A linklog is a type of blog which is meant to act as a linked list.
> Common practice is for the post titles to link directly to an external URLs, and the content of the post includes information to complement the associated URL.

I found out about it on Simon Willison's [blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/) where he lists (among other ideas) three topics to use for a link blog:

- Things I learned
- things I found
- Descriptions of my projects
