![Denton Welch]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2025-03-16-denton-welch/denton.jpg)

I discovered Denton Welsh by way of William Burroughs, who named Denton as the author who had most influenced him. I had enjoyed reading Junky by Burroughs and so I decided to check Denton out, and I'm glad I did.

Here's a quote which Burroughs used to show the individuality of Denton's writing:

>I had not ridden since I was ten years old, when my horrible little black pony had at last been given away. How I had hated it! Once it had broken out of the stable and had galloped through the roses and over the lawns, showing its awful yellow teeth.

I look forward to making my way through the articles in the blog [www.dentonwelch.com](www.dentonwelch.com), which charts the author's discovery of Denton, and does not seem to be an armchair-based discovery but includes expeditions around the Tonbridge and Greenwich areas where Denton lived and based his stories, including lots of pictures of the places themselves and where they appear in the stories.
